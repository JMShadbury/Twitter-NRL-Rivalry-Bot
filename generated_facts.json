Just like your weekend plans, eh John? #BitOfBanter", "In 1993, the @brisbanebroncos found their way to the Grand Final by defeating the @RaidersCanberra in a dramatic 23-16 point thriller. Good thing Raider's hadn't invented GPS, they might've found their way to a win!", "Knock, knock. Who's there? Not @RaidersCanberra after @brisbanebroncos spectacular 56-18 drubbing back in 2014.

One team's glory, another's...ongoing safari? #JohnTheJoker", "Flashback to 2015, when '@brisbanebroncos outscored the @RaidersCanberra 96-6 over two games. Canberra's defense was busier than a chipmunk at an acorn convention...and more frazzled!", "Fun fact - in round 13, 2016, @brisbanebroncos galloped past the @RaidersCanberra with a 26-18 victory, leaving the Raiders green with envy!
