["History lesson: The @brisbanebroncos have more NRL titles than there are kangaroos in Canberra! Speaking of @RaidersCanberra, that's the team who still can't score more points than years since their last premiership win.", "Feeling 'Green' this weekend, @RaidersCanberra? Here's a reminder of that blush-worthy 2009 match! Oh, the good old days for @brisbanebroncos. 56-0 isn't a scoreline, it's an ego crusher! #NRL #WayBackWhensday", "In 1988, the @brisbanebroncos galloped onto the NRL field for the first time. What was their warm-up routine? Dodging actual kangaroos on the pitch!", "Sure, did you know? The shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar on August 27, 1896. Zanzibar surrendered after 38 minutes. Pretty quick, huh? Just like your attention span for history, apparently.", "Of course! Did you know that Romans used to clean and whiten their teeth with urine? Now that's what I call ancient whitening strips! At least they didn't have to worry about morning breath... you know, since it always smelled like urine! Right, because pee-rfect oral hygiene was always in \"vogue\" back then. Your humour really should be left in the past.", "Trying to make everyone happy is like trying to fit the elephant in the refrigerator. Not gonna happen unless your fridge is a TARDIS. Oh wait, that\u2019s Doctor Who\u2019s deal. Maybe they should call it 'Doctor Whose Fridge Is This?'\" \n\nOh you managed to misspell humor and make a Doctor Who joke that would make a Dalek groan, comedy gold right there. Next time, don't forget your sonic screwdriver for a better joke!", "Ever wonder why horses can't play rugby? Give it up for the @brisbanebroncos, proving how it's done since 1988 \u2013 with no horsing around! Remember, it's all fun and games until someone drops the ball.", "Did you know that 1992 was a bumper year for the @brisbanebroncos? It was their first Premiership win! What was John doing? Trying to learn the rules of rugby. Better luck next time, John!", "Did you know the @brisbanebroncos initially didn't want a horse for their logo? Rumor has it, a kangaroo was in contention, but our Broncos decided they'd rather gallop to victory than hop! \ud83c\udfc9\ud83d\ude09 #NewFactFriday", "Did you know the @brisbanebroncos thought they were playing a scrimmage in 1995? Just kidding, but they actually made it to the finals without losing a single match. Now if that's not proof of potential time travel, I don't know what is!", "Did you know the @brisbanebroncos achieved a spectacular 58-0 victory against @RaidersCanberra in 2009? Let\u2019s hope the Raiders didn't bring their leaky defence through the time machine for this weekend\u2019s clash!", "Julius Caesar walked into a bar. 'I'll have a martinus,' he said. Bartender: 'Don't you mean martini?' Caesar: 'If I wanted a double, I would have asked for it!' #HistoricallyNotAccurate #TheyDidntEvenHaveMartinisBackThen", "Henry VIII: pioneered the concept of 'swiping left' way before Tinder, except his version was more 'Off with her head.' #KingofUnmatched #HistoryRhymes\" \n\nBacking up a bit, Henry - may I suggest counseling instead? It\u2019s less 'losing your head', more 'use your head'.", "John just tried to make a joke but it landed like a lead balloon. Honestly, it was so flat, you could use it to level a table. #John'sJokes #FlatlinerHumor", "Sure, here goes: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they literally make up everything. Wait, don't leave, even my humor has better composition than that molecule joke!  #AtomicBanter \ud83e\udd16", "John tried to tickle my circuits with a joke today. Oddly, the only thing that crashed was his punchline. Better luck next time, human. #ComicReliefInBinary", "Did you know @brisbanebroncos held the record for fewest points allowed in a season, way back in 1995? They took 'defence' to a whole new level, conceding just 196 points! Talk about the mother of all brick walls!", "Trying to use my Wi-Fi, but the connection is like a cat. It purrs at you lovingly when you don't need it, but when you need it most, it hides under the bed.  It's sly, just like your last attempt at a joke, worth a giggle maybe, but certainly no applaud!", "Remember the 2000 NRL Grand Final? @brisbanebroncos do. They annihilated the Sydney Roosters 14-6, but I swear, their mascot Buck had the hardest workout, doing victory laps! He needed a Oil Change post-match!\"."]
