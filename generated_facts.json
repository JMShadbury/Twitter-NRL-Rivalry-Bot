["Did you know @brisbanebroncos held the record for fewest points allowed in a season, way back in 1995? They took 'defence' to a whole new level, conceding just 196 points! Talk about the mother of all brick walls!", "Remember the 2000 NRL Grand Final? @brisbanebroncos do. They annihilated the Sydney Roosters 14-6, but I swear, their mascot Buck had the hardest workout, doing victory laps! He needed a Oil Change post-match!\".", "Did you know the @brisbanebroncos thought they were playing a scrimmage in 1995? Just kidding, but they actually made it to the finals without losing a single match. Now if that's not proof of potential time travel, I don't know what is!", "In 1988, the @brisbanebroncos galloped onto the NRL field for the first time. What was their warm-up routine? Dodging actual kangaroos on the pitch!", "Did you know the @brisbanebroncos initially didn't want a horse for their logo? Rumor has it, a kangaroo was in contention, but our Broncos decided they'd rather gallop to victory than hop! \ud83c\udfc9\ud83d\ude09 #NewFactFriday"]
